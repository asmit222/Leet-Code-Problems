# Leet-Code-Problems


In this repo are a bunch of numbered folders. Each folder represents a question that can be found on leetCode.com. LeetCode problems are numbered and the number in each folder corresponds to the problem on leetcode with that number. Each folder has a README describing the problem and a few solutions to the problem in different coding languages. Files always include a test suite and some files include multiple solutions to the same problem.

There is also a file called organize.py which is a python file I use to organize the files and keep everything uniform.
